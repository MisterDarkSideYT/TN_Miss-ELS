# 🚨 MISS-ELS: Matsn0w's Incredible Server-Sided ELS

![MISS-ELS](assets/MISS-ELS_Logo.png)

MISS-ELS is an all-in-one configurable Emergency Lighting System (ELS) for the popular Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) multiplayer client called FiveM.

The server-side element restricts controls to the driver (and optionally his passengers) and allows you to activate primary, secondary and warning lighting each with individually configurable key-bindings.

Welcome to the best server-sided Emergency Lighting System for FiveM!

Oh, and you might ask yourself where all the 'Els' or 'Miss Els' jokes come from. It's a [meme](https://youtu.be/X-PgamXIWRQ?t=75). Loes is calling her grandchild Els. Els? Els! ELS!

## ⚡ Key Features

MISS ELS is very different compared to most other ELS resources! These are some key features:

- Fully customizable light patterns
- Support for up to 36 independent light sources (12 extras + 26 miscs)
- Use native game sirens or use your own with [WMServerSirens](https://github.com/Walsheyy/WMServerSirens)
- Optional light reflections around the vehicle
- [A VCF configuration wizard](https://matsn0w.github.io/MISS-ELS) to make your life easier

Furthermore...

- Sirens and lights synced across the entire server
- Support for 3 different light stages
- Support for up to 4 different sirens per vehicle
- Indicator controls
- Flashing high beams
- Stop sign beeping
- Customizable personal keybinds
- ...

## 🧩 Requirements

You need to have the following resources installed on your server:

- [FiveM baseevents](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/resources/baseevents) (shipped by default)
- [WarMenu](https://github.com/warxander/warmenu)

## ⚙️ Installation and Configuration

See the instructions in the [documentation](docs/README.md)!

## 🚓 Vehicle Configuration Files

If you have any existing VCF files from the [original author](https://github.com/InfImpSolutions) of this resource, then you'll probably be fine. The XML should be fully backwards compatible.

**⚠️ If you have a VCF from any other resource, that'll most likely not work.**

In both cases, it's probably best to re-create them by either writing them yourself OR... use the convient configuration GUI! Using this tool, you can easily generate configuration files for your vehicles. You can find it here:
